**quadrobounce!** for iOS

This project was my first learning experience with iOS development and cocos2d. Full disclosure: it's ugly.

I decided to upload/open-source this project for two reasons: 1) to add to my portfolio, and 2) to possibly help others who are just learning. I also hope that exposing this to the world will motivate me to clean up the project, and possibly update it.

No license, no restrictions...it's just out there.
